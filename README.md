# Data analysis of Hotel Booking Dataset using Python where I analyzed the hotel booking dataset to understand factors contributing to high cancellation rates in both City and Resort hotels.



# Key Objective
To understand the reasons for higher cancellation rates in City and Resort hotels and recommend strategies to minimize cancellations and maximize revenue.

#  Analysis Steps

## 1️ .Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Handled missing values by using mode for 'country' and median for 'children.'
Converted date columns into proper formats for analysis.
Removed irrelevant columns to focus on impactful features.
## 2️. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Found cancellation rates of 41.73% for City Hotels and 27.76% for Resort Hotels.
Explored correlations between cancellations and factors like market segments, meal plans, lead time, and ADR (Average Daily Rate).
Identified Portugal (PRT) as the top country for bookings and cancellations.
## 3. Data Visualization:

Used bar and line charts to highlight trends by hotel type, meal plan, lead time, and ADR.
Bar charts revealed the relationship between market segments and cancellations.
Visualized cancellation patterns by month and country for clearer insights.
# Key Insights
## 1️. Higher ADR Leads to More Cancellations

Elevated room prices correlate with increased cancellations, impacting revenue.
## 2️. Group Segment Drives High Cancellations

The "Groups" market segment had the highest cancellation rates.
## 3️. High Cancellations in Specific Countries

Countries like Portugal (PRT), Great Britain (GBR), and Spain (ESP) showed significantly higher cancellation rates.
## 4️.Seasonal Peaks in Cancellations

Cancellations peak in months with higher ADRs (e.g., January for City Hotels, June for Resort Hotels).
## 5️. OTAs and Groups Contribute to High Cancellations

Bookings via OTAs (Online Travel Agents) and the Groups segment were frequent contributors to cancellations.
## 6️. Long Lead Times = Higher Cancellations

Customers booking well in advance were more likely to cancel.
#  Actionable Recommendations

Offer discounts or flexible policies for early bookings to reduce cancellations with long lead times.
Revamp pricing strategies for peak months and key countries to minimize cancellations.
Focus on better marketing and engagement with the Groups segment and OTAs.
